# Web4Beginners

This collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files is intended to help beginners learn how the Web works and how Web pages are made.

I started writing a series of blog posts (in February 2013) to encourage journalism educators to teach students how to code. The first post is [Get started with Web coding. Part 1: HTML and CSS](http://mindymcadams.com/tojou/2013/get-started-with-web-coding-part-1-html-and-css/). It's only about learning HTML and CSS.

Files here that are relevant to that first post:

+ [Basic HTML starter file](basic_html_page.html)
+ [Basic CSS starter file](style.css) -- linked to the HTML file
+ [The 411 on HTML5, Part 1](Step_1_The_HEAD.md) -- explains the newest version of the HEAD element 

If you are a beginner, download the HTML and CSS files (two files). Open both in your text editor program. At the same time, open the HTML file in your Web browser. And then ... *play.* Change things. Save. Reload the Web page. See what happens.

This is how we learn.
